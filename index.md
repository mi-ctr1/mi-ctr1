# Hi, I'm Mi 👋

I'm learning software engineering while completing Sophia courses and working through The Odin Project.

This site documents what I’m learning, what I’m building, and what I’m figuring out along the way.

## First Post: Starting From Zero
I’m at the very beginning of my coding journey. This week I:
- Created my first GitHub repository
- Learned basic Git commands
- Started HTML with The Odin Project

My goal is to become job-ready by the end of the year and document the process honestly.

More coming soon 🚀
